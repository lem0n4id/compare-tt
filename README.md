With this static site, you can compare timetable with your classmates without needing to read through it. 

> Note- This has only been tested with VIT Chennai timetable. It might not work for other campuses. Please raise an issue if you face any problems

## How to use

1. Copy your timetable and paste it in the first textbox
1. Have someone send over their time table and paste in the second textbox
1. Hit submit! ⚡

## Tech stack used

HTML, CSS(barely) and JS!

## How it works

I have used RegEx to identify the course code and venue to determine if you have same classes or not
